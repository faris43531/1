<p>&nbsp;Lung injury: E-cigarette, or vaping, product use-associated lung injury (EVALI) is a new phenomenon that occurs as a result of vaping. Most cases occur due to products that contain tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), which comes from cannabis. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source, by early 2020, there had been around 2,800 cases of EVALI, with 68 of those resulting in death.</p><span><!--more--></span><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh5GwLtvkCv0nJJFe8O7qZueorNJDjrKIH8Hv2SupzW3a1QcPa7bDv1BwPXxwROK2aBl4At_8etU7LEvuE9pY2EI3FkprgrpyTPeo0h5FRd_cshOMOTiRySlcHE-8n4mON2ACU07wK5ZzwZtRPG7dUmAEZrMuvK7p9zO9Qgvebttai37MgcoM2LgdWk7Ko/s360/kit%20%2872%29.png" /></div><p>&nbsp;Health services in the United Kingdom say that vaping can be an effective tool for quitting smoking. Additionally, in 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Trusted Source permitted the marketing of three e-cigarette products, specifically citing their potential benefit in helping people quit smoking.</p><p>&nbsp;A 2021 studyTrusted Source found that daily e-cigarette usage among tobacco smokers can increase the likelihood of quitting smoking eightfold. Researchers assessed data from the 2014­–2019 Population Assessment of Tobacco and Health (PATH) study, focusing on smokers who were not planning to quit smoking at the start of the period.</p><p>&nbsp;One of the best things about vaping is its versatility. It offers a wide range of flavours and devices that cater to every preference. The latest modern designs are compact, lightweight and stylish. From big puff disposables and prefilled kits to refillable devices, their user-friendly designs are quick and straightforward to get into. They are popular choices for beginners who wish to make a successful switch from smoking to vaping.</p><p>&nbsp;In addition to its convenience, vaping offers huge health and cost benefits. It provides a much less harmful alternative to smoking by eliminating combustion and the harmful chemicals from burnt tobacco. Not only that, but by switching to vaping, smokers can save a significant amount of money compared to their tobacco habit.</p><p>&nbsp;For beginners, knowing where to start, which vape kit to use and which e-liquids to choose, can still seem a bit daunting. So in this article we're going to cover every type of vape style, device and e-liquid on offer. Whether you’re a beginner or an experienced vaper, this guide will equip you with knowledge and tips to vape like a pro!</p><p>&nbsp;Vape Kits: This is the main component of your setup and comes in various forms, such as vape pens, pod systems and box mods. Think about what you want from vaping and choose a device that suits your preferences and experience level. Research different e-cig devices to find the one that best fits your needs.</p><p>&nbsp;Batteries: Starter kits are designed with built-in batteries, that you can simply plug in and charge as you would a phone, with a variety of devices offering greater charge capacity than others. If you opt for a device that requires external batteries (such as box mods & sub-ohm kits), you’ll need to purchase compatible rechargeable batteries. Make sure that you choose high-quality batteries from reputable brands to ensure safety. Rechargeable batteries have the advantage of fast charging when used with an external battery charger.</p><p>&nbsp;E-Liquid: Also known as vape juice, E-liquid is what you’ll be inhaling. It typically consists of a blend of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerine (VG), flavourings and the option of nicotine. Be honest about how much you smoke and start with nicotine that matches your requirements or consider nicotine-free options if your motivation is purely recreational.</p><p>&nbsp;Coils: Coils are small, cylindrical heating elements comprising of a metal mesh screen or coil filament wrapped in cotton, that absorbs and vaporises the e-liquid when heated up by your device. Replacing coils forms the main part of your maintenance routine, they have a limited lifespan and will need to be replaced every 1 to 2 weeks (depending on use). They come in different sizes and coil resistances which affect the amount of vapour produced</p><p>&nbsp;Pod/Tank: This is the part of the device that holds the e-liquid and houses the coil. After the Tobacco Products Directive (TPD) Regulations, all pods and vape tanks in the UK are regulated to a 2ml max capacity. Some offer top-fill options or side refilling which are worth consideration.</p><p>&nbsp;Charger: The majority of modern vape devices incorporate Type-C charging and many devices will include a charging cable with the kit, if not make sure to purchase one if you do not already have one in possession. If you are using a device with external batteries we recommend purchasing a separate battery charger which works far more efficiently than charging directly from the device.</p><p>&nbsp;Vape kits generally cater to three styles of vaping: mouth-to-lung (MTL), restricted direct-to-lung, (RDL), and direct-to-lung (DTL). Each style of vaping offers a different vaping experience, and it is important to consider what your vaping goals are before making a purchase.</p><p>&nbsp;MTL (mouth-to-lung) vaping is perfect if you want to switch from smoking to vaping. Disposable vapes are good introductory MTL kits, but long term, the best vaping device for beginners is a refillable pod kit. An MTL pod vape replicates the feel of drawing on a cigarette: you draw the vapour into your mouth and hold it there for a second before inhaling it.</p><p>&nbsp;Beginner vape kits typically have a tighter draw and produce a discrete amount of vapour. They utilise high PG e-liquids and high resistance coils ranging from 0.8ohm to 1.5ohm with lower wattage output ranging from 10 - 25W. MTL vaping delivers a recognisable and satisfying throat hit and is suitable for higher nicotine strengths.</p><p>&nbsp;Most MTL pod kits are fitted with a smart chip and pressure sensor incorporating an inhale activation function that vapes your juice as you inhale. You will find this feature on all disposable vape bars and most refillable pod kits. Auto-draw vapes is a really helpful feature for beginners that will make your vaping journey much easier, you simply inhale on the device to activate it as you would a cigarette.</p><p>&nbsp;DTL (direct-to-lung), also known as sub-ohm vaping, is the complete opposite of MTL where the user inhales the vapour directly into their lungs in one deep breath. DTL vaping typically uses powerful box mod devices and sub-ohm tanks with larger airflow openings, low resistance coils in the 0.15ohm to 0.5ohm range and high wattage settings of 25 - 200W.  </p><p>&nbsp;Combined with thicker high VG e-liquids, DTL vaping produces denser clouds and a much smoother vape experience with virtually no throat hit. Since there is a larger volume of vapour being inhaled, DTL vaping is often associated with lower nicotine strengths, as the increased amount of vapour being inhaled carries more nicotine per puff.</p><p>&nbsp;Direct-to-lung vaping is a marvellous way to explore the profusion of complex flavours that vaping has to offer with or without nicotine - and it is just plain fun. Although keep in mind that due to the huge clouds of vapour produced, this style of vaping may not be suitable in many public situations such as work environments or crowded areas. Consider if DTL vaping is suitable to your lifestyle requirements. It is common for seasoned vapers to choose use their sub-ohm kit at home and take an MTL pod kit when they leave the house.</p><a href="https://www.razvape.org"><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Raz Vape Flavors </span></b></a><br /><p>&nbsp;Providing a "best-of-both-worlds" solution that falls between the two traditional types of vape styles is RDL (restricted direct-to-lung) vaping. In RDL the user inhales the vapour directly into their lungs, bypassing the mouth-to-lung process, but with a tighter draw compared to the direct-to-lung style. Many vapers enjoy RDL as it delivers a richer flavour-focused vape with a more civilised amount of vapour production than the airy DTL. RDL vaping typically uses pod devices fitted with lower resistance coils between the ranges of 0.6ohm to 0.9ohm and provides the benefit of versatility as it can be enjoyed with both high PG or high VG e-liquids.</p><p>&nbsp;Many electronic cigarettes feature an adjustable airflow function that lets you personalise your airflow from a tight to loose draw. A more restricted airflow will produce a warm & flavour-dense vape experience, it is important that you don't completely shut the airflow as this will overheat and damage the coil.</p><p>&nbsp;Beginners making the switch to MTL vaping will need an e-liquid that contains at least 50% PG. The presence of PG not only enhances the flavour but also provides the desired throat hit that smokers often seek. High PG e-liquids are thinner in consistency, allowing for the vaping of higher nicotine levels (up to 20mg). These liquids are ideal for lower-powered pod devices and deliver an optimal vaping experience for new starters.</p><p>&nbsp;DTL vaping, on the other hand, uses high VG e-liquids, typically with a ratio of 65% or higher and are available in premixed 10ml bottles or larger 50ml & 100ml e-liquids called shortfills. Shortfills contain no nicotine, but you can add some with a nic shot.</p><p>&nbsp;Vegetable glycerine (VG) has a syrupy consistency and when used with low resistance coils, it produces a large amount of velvety and rich vapour without any harsh throat sensation. The substantial increase in vapour production means you get tons of intricate flavour and also means that you only need 3mg of nicotine since you inhale a greater quantity in one go.</p><p>&nbsp;Nic salts are great for beginners who want to successfully switch from smoking to vaping. The closest thing to a cigarette, MTL vaping with nicotine salts offers a smooth and gratifying throat hit that isn't overly harsh, allowing you to indulge in higher nicotine concentrations such as 5mg, 10mg, or 20mg. The bioavailability of the nic salt formulation ensures rapid absorption and near-instant and long-lasting satisfaction. What's more, nicotine salts do not compromise the taste of the e-liquid, allowing you to enjoy the most flavourful MTL vaping experience available. If you would like to know more about nic salts, check out this handy article.</p><p>&nbsp;Freebase is a synthetic nicotine e-liquid variant that provides a distinctly strong throat sensation at 12mg and an intense hit at 18mg, making it primarily suitable for heavy smokers. However, it's worth noting that the flavours may become less pronounced in this strength. If you're aiming to reduce nicotine intake, the 3mg and 6mg options are perfect choices. They offer a satisfying throat hit without discomfort while maintaining a decent amount of flavour.</p><p>&nbsp;Most of today's starter vape devices use the refillable pod system design, which uses a 2ml refillable plastic pod which fits into the vape device, instead of the traditional glass tank design of the past. The refillable pod is best kit for beginners as they are very user-friendly. Variations include a fixed coil pod in which the coil is fitted into the pod and is not removable, with the idea that when the coil is spent, you swap out the entire pod for a new one, thereby minimising maintenance. Alternatively, a pod with a removable coil system uses an empty pod with replaceable coils that slot into the base of the pod, thus minimising waste.</p><p>&nbsp;Beginner pod kits can be refilled by simply unclipping the mouthpiece. This means that you don’t need to remove the pod to refill it, making topping up a quick and mess-free experience. Side refilling, on the other hand, is achieved by lifting a silicone stopper on the side of the pod. You will need to remove the pod in order to do this, so not as hassle-free as top refilling, but still very straightforward. It’s entirely down to personal preference. Top refilling is much easier but a pod kit with side refilling may have additional build features that suit your needs.</p><p>&nbsp;The refillable pod system is also popular with DTL vape kits for sub-ohm vaping. The only difference is that the aperture of the mouthpiece will be larger to accommodate the increased airflow. Traditional glass tanks are still widely used as well, they feature a glass chamber with a stainless steel top and base component, and refilling is usually achieved by unscrewing or sliding the out the mouthpiece.</p><p>&nbsp;Beginners often struggle to figure out when to change a coil out as there are various factors at play that can affect the lifespan of your coil. Your vaping style, e-liquid and the frequency with which you vape can have an impact. There are a number of tell-tale signs that will let you know it is time for a fresh replacement.</p><p>&nbsp;Cleaning - Address any leaks immediately. Grab some kitchen roll and take action by removing the pod or tank, absorbing any spills within the pod chamber or tank connection and thoroughly wiping everything down. Dust and debris can also accumulate over time and impact the operation of your device.</p><p>&nbsp;Recycle Responsibly: Dispose of your vaping waste, such as empty e-liquid bottles or used coils, according to your local authorities' guidelines. Recycle old vape kits, disposables and batteries at your nearest electrical waste recycling centre and avoid littering or leaving vaping-related debris behind.</p><p>&nbsp;By taking into consideration your vaping goals, whether it's quitting tobacco or just for fun, you can work out the most suitable vape style that suits your needs. This will enable you to focus on selecting the right device, e-liquid, and nicotine strength that works for you.</p><p>&nbsp;www.vapesuperstore.co.uk contains general information about vaping and vapour products.
